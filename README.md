# 2019 Advent of Code

## Notes

#### Day 13, Part 2 (Missing)

Need to visualise the game board, so I can step through a bit to figure out
what remains to be handled. I presume blocks will need to be removed and the
paddle manipulated for the game to play through to proper completion.

#### Day 14, Part 2

This is not efficient at all. It took ~20mins to complete.  At the very least, I
could try to speed up the looped process, which was designed for comprehension
rather than memory/CPU usage.

It's also possible this process has some kind of periodicity that could be leveraged
to skip forward in the calculation?
